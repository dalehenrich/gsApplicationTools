# Debugging controls - uncomemnt and edit debugging env vars as desired:

# The default behaviour is to delete this process's log file if it exits
# normally. If you want to keep this process's log file even on normal exit
# then uncomment the following
#
# export GEMSTONE_KEEP_LOG=1

#  Print Smalltalk stack and instance counts when OutOfMemory error occurs
#
# export GS_DEBUG_VMGC_VERBOSE_OUTOFMEM=1

# --------------------------------
# GS_DEBUG_VMGC_PRINT_MKSW_MEMORY_USED specifies a percent of memory
# used threshold.
# If the GS_DEBUG_VMGC_PRINT_MKSW_MEMORY_USED environment variable
# is not defined, the default is 75 percent.
# At the end of each mark sweep, if the percent used is greater than
# this threshold, the markSweep is printed, the Smalltalk stack
# is printed to stdout, and the threshold is raised by 5 percent.  Thus in
# situation producing error 4067, OutOfMemory, you should get several
# Smalltalk stacks printed in the gem log file before the session dies.
#
# export GS_DEBUG_VMGC_PRINT_MKSW_MEMORY_USED=75
